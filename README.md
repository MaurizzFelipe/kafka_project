# Project Title: Stock market data pipeline and dashboard using Apache Kafka, postgresql and Power BI

**Description**:

This project demonstrates how to create a simple data pipeline to extract data from a stock market api and to dump the data into a sql database. (Postgresql) 

The project is a hands-on demonstration of how to design and implement a basic data pipeline to extract real-time stock market data from a public API and store it efficiently in a PostgreSQL database.

## In this project, we aim to achieve the following objectives:

**Data Extraction**: 

We will explore and select a suitable stock market API to retrieve financial data, such as stock prices, trading volumes, and other relevant information.

**Data Transformation**: 

After obtaining the data from the API, we will preprocess and transform it to ensure that it aligns with the schema of our target database. This step involves data cleaning, formatting, and organizing the retrieved data.

**PostgreSQL Setup**: 

We will set up a PostgreSQL database that will act as our storage repository for the stock market data. We will define the necessary tables and columns to accommodate the extracted data.

**Data Loading**: 

Once the PostgreSQL database is ready, we will design a script to load the transformed data into the appropriate tables. This involves establishing a connection to the database, processing the data, and executing SQL commands to insert the data efficiently.

## Database Connection and Dashboard Development: 

We will connect the databases we develop and create an analytical dashboard with the data to understand data patterns. Leveraging popular data visualization techniques, the dashboard will include charts, graphs, and other visualizations to provide stakeholders with insights into the data.

## Overview

Here you want to write a short overview of the goals of your project and how it works at a high level. If possible, include one or two images of the end product and architecture diagram (see examples below). diagrams.net is a great tool for creating architecture diagrams.

### Data Visualization

### Data Architecture

If you decide to include this, you should also talk a bit about why you chose the architecture and tools you did for this project.

## How to Run This Project

Replace the example step-by-step instructions with your own.

1. Install x packages
2. Run command: `python x`
3. Make sure it's running properly by checking z
4. To clean up at the end, run script: `python cleanup.py`

## Lessons Learned

It's good to reflect on what you learned throughout the process of building this project. Here you might discuss what you would have done differently if you had more time/money/data. Did you end up choosing the right tools or would you try something else next time?
